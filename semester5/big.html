          <li><strong>Union:</strong> Combines the results of two queries, removing duplicates.</li>
          <li><strong>Difference:</strong> Retrieves rows from one table that are not in another.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h4>2. Parallel Databases</h4>
      <p><strong>Parallel Databases</strong> use multiple processors to perform operations on large datasets in parallel, improving performance and scalability. Key aspects include:</p>
      <ul>

          <li><strong>Reduce:</strong> Aggregates intermediate data based on the key to produce the final output.</li>
      </ul>
    
  
      <h4>4. Hadoop</h4>
      <p><strong>Hadoop</strong> is an open-source framework that supports the distributed processing of large datasets across clusters of computers. Key components include:</p>
      <ul>

          <li><strong>MapReduce:</strong> A programming model for processing data in parallel across a Hadoop cluster.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h4>5. The Design of HDFS</h4>
      <p><strong>HDFS</strong> is designed to store vast amounts of data across multiple servers while providing high throughput and fault tolerance. Key concepts include:</p>
      <ul>
          <li><strong>Blocks:</strong> Files are split into fixed-size blocks, which are replicated across multiple nodes.</li>
          <li><strong>NameNode:</strong> Manages the metadata and namespace of the file system.</li>
          <li><strong>DataNodes:</strong> Store the actual data blocks and handle read and write requests.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h4>6. Command Line Interface</h4>
      <p><strong>HDFS Command Line Interface (CLI)</strong> allows users to interact with the Hadoop file system. Common commands include:</p>
      <ul>
          <li><strong>hdfs dfs -ls:</strong> Lists files and directories in HDFS.</li>
          <li><strong>hdfs dfs -put:</strong> Uploads files to HDFS.</li>
          <li><strong>hdfs dfs -get:</strong> Downloads files from HDFS.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h4>7. Hadoop File System Interface and Relationship to Databases</h4>

          <li><strong>Schema:</strong> HDFS is schema-less, while traditional databases have a fixed schema.</li>
          <li><strong>Query Language:</strong> HDFS uses MapReduce, while traditional databases use SQL.</li>
          <li><strong>Data Storage:</strong> HDFS is optimized for large-scale data processing, while traditional databases are optimized for transaction processing.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h4>8. Algorithms, Extensions, and Languages</h4>
      <p><strong>Algorithms</strong> used in Hadoop include sorting, filtering, and aggregating data in MapReduce jobs. <strong>Extensions</strong> such as Hive and Pig provide higher-level abstractions for querying and processing data. <strong>Languages</strong> used include:</p>
      <ul>
          <li><strong>Java:</strong> Primary language for writing MapReduce programs.</li>
          <li><strong>SQL:</strong> Used with Hive for querying data in HDFS.</li>
          <li><strong>Pig Latin:</strong> A scripting language for processing data in Pig.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h4>9. Key-Value Stores and NoSQL</h4>
      <p><strong>Key-Value Stores</strong> are a type of NoSQL database where each data item is stored as a key-value pair. Examples include:</p>
      <ul>
          <li><strong>Redis:</strong> An in-memory key-value store.</li>
          <li><strong>Riak:</strong> A distributed key-value store with high availability.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>NoSQL Databases</strong> are designed to handle unstructured and semi-structured data. They include:</p>
      <ul>
          <li><strong>Document Stores:</strong> Store data as documents (e.g., MongoDB).</li>
          <li><strong>Column Stores:</strong> Store data in columns rather than rows (e.g., Cassandra).</li>
          <li><strong>Graph Databases:</strong> Store data as nodes and edges (e.g., Neo4j).</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Tradeoffs between SQL and NoSQL:</strong></p>
      <ul>
          <li><strong>SQL:</strong> Provides ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) and is suitable for structured data and complex queries.</li>
          <li><strong>NoSQL:</strong> Offers flexibility in data models, scalability, and high performance for large-scale data and real-time applications.</li>
