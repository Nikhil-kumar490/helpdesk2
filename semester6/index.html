      <h1>Classification of Digital Images</h1>

      <mark><que>1. What are the two main types of digital images?</que></mark>
      <ans>
          <p>Digital images can be broadly classified into two types:</p>
          <ul>
              <li><b>Raster Images or Bitmap Images</b></li>
              <li><b>Vector Images</b></li>
          </ul>
      </ans>
  
      <mark><que>2. What are Raster Images or Bitmap Images?</que></mark>
      <ans>
          <p>A <b>raster image</b> or <b>bitmap image</b> is a digital image made up of small squares called <b>pixels</b>, each containing color and brightness information. Raster images are commonly used for photographs and detailed images.</p>
      </ans>
  
      <mark><que>3. How does resolution affect raster images?</que></mark>
      <ans>
          <p>The resolution of a raster image, measured in <b>dots per inch (dpi)</b> or <b>pixels per inch (ppi)</b>, determines its quality. Higher resolution results in a clearer image, but raster graphics are resolution-dependent. Enlarging a raster image can cause pixelation, making the image appear blurry.</p>
      </ans>
  
      <mark><que>4. What are the common file formats for raster images?</que></mark>
      <ans>
          <p>Raster images come in various file formats, each with specific uses:</p>
          <ul>
              <li><b>JPEG (JPG):</b> Used for photographs due to its lossy compression.</li>
              <li><b>PNG:</b> Supports transparency and is commonly used for web graphics.</li>
              <li><b>GIF:</b> Used for simple animations but has a limited color palette.</li>
              <li><b>BMP:</b> A high-quality, uncompressed image format.</li>

      </ans>
  
      <mark><que>6. How do vector images differ from raster images?</que></mark>
      <ans>
          <p>Vector images are <b>scalable</b>, meaning they can be resized without losing quality. Unlike raster images, which become pixelated when enlarged, vector images maintain sharpness at any size.</p>
      </ans>
  
      <mark><que>7. What are the common file formats for vector images?</que></mark>
      <ans>
          <p>Vector images are stored in various formats designed for different purposes:</p>
          <ul>
              <li><b>SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics):</b> Used for web graphics due to its small file size and scalability.</li>
              <li><b>AI (Adobe Illustrator):</b> A standard format for professional graphic design.</li>
              <li><b>EPS (Encapsulated PostScript):</b> Commonly used in print and publishing.</li>
              <li><b>PDF (Portable Document Format):</b> Can store both vector and raster elements.</li>
          </ul>
      </ans>
  
      <mark><que>8. What are the advantages of vector images?</que></mark>
      <ans>
          <p>Vector images have several advantages:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>They are <b>scalable</b> and maintain high quality at any size.</li>
              <li>They have <b>smaller file sizes</b> compared to high-resolution raster images.</li>
              <li>They allow for easy <b>editing and modification</b> without losing quality.</li>
          </ul>
      </ans>
  
      <mark><que>9. What are the limitations of vector images?</que></mark>

      </ans>
  


    <h1>Convolution and Correlation</h1>

    <mark><que>1. What are Convolution and Correlation?</que></mark>
    <ans>
        <p>Convolution and Correlation operations are used to extract information from images. These operations are linear and shift-invariant. The term "linear" indicates that a pixel is replaced by the linear combination of its neighbors, while "shift-invariant" means the same operation is applied at every point in the image.</p>
    </ans>

    <mark><que>2. What is Convolution?</que></mark>
    <ans>
        <p>Convolution is a mathematical operation where each value in the output is expressed as the sum of values in the input multiplied by a set of weighting coefficients. Depending on these coefficients, convolution can be used for low-pass and high-pass filtering of images, allowing for image sharpening or smoothing.</p>
    </ans>

    <mark><que>3. What are the applications of Convolution?</que></mark>
    <ans>
        <p>Convolution is widely used in:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Image Filtering</li>
            <li>Image Enhancement</li>
            <li>Image Restoration</li>
            <li>Feature Extraction</li>
            <li>Template Matching</li>
        </ul>
    </ans>

    <mark><que>4. What is 1-D Convolution for Continuous Signals?</que></mark>
    <ans>
        <p>The 1-D convolution for continuous signals is given by:</p>
        <pre> y (t) = ∫−∞∞ x (T ) . h(t−T ) . dT </pre>
    </ans>

    <mark><que>5. What is 1-D Convolution for Discrete Signals?</que></mark>
    <ans>
        <p>The 1-D convolution for discrete signals is given by:</p>
        <pre> y (n) = ∑ K=−∞∞ x (K) . h(n−K) </pre>
    </ans>

    <mark><que>6. What is 2-D Convolution?</que></mark>
    <ans>
        <p>The 2-D convolution is given by:</p>
        <pre> f (x , y) ∗ g(x , y) = ∫T₁=−∞∞ ∫T₂=−∞∞ f (T₁T₂) g(x−T₁, y−T₂) dT₁ dT₂ </pre>
    </ans>

    <mark><que>7. What are the different methods to perform 2-D Convolution?</que></mark>
    <ans>
        <p>2-D Convolution can be performed using:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Convolution through Z-transform</li>
            <li>Convolution through Graphical Method</li>
            <li>Convolution through Matrix Analysis</li>
        </ol>
    </ans>

    <mark><que>8. What is Convolution through Z-transform?</que></mark>
    <ans>
        <p>The concept of convolution in the spatial domain is equal to multiplication in the frequency domain. This principle is utilized to compute convolution through the Z-transform.</p>
        <p>The convolution between two frequencies x(n₁, n₂) and h(n₁, n₂) is given by:</p>
        <pre> y(n₁, n₂) = x(n₁, n₂) ** h(n₁, n₂) </pre>
        <p>Here, ** indicates 2D convolution.</p>
    </ans>

    <mark><que>9. How does Z-transform relate to Convolution?</que></mark>
    <ans>
        <p>Taking the Z-transform on both sides of the convolution equation:</p>
        <pre> Y(Z₁, Z₂) = X(Z₁, Z₂) * h(Z₁, Z₂) </pre>
        <p>This implies that convolution in one domain is equivalent to multiplication in another domain.</p>
    </ans>

      <strong><u>Run-length coding (Lossless compression algorithm)</u></strong>
      <br>
      Run-length coding (RLC) exploits the repetitive nature of the image. It tries to identify the length of the pixel values and encodes the images in the form of a run. Each row of the image is written as a sequence. Then the length is represented as a run of black or white pixels. This is an effective way of compressing an image. If necessary, there can be farther compression using variable length coding to code the ran length themselves. The technique scans the image row by row and identifies the ran . The output ran length vector specifies the pixel value and the length of the run. <br>
      <img src="../assets/images/image_processing/img_pro1.png" alt="" id="img1">
      <br>
      <center><i>Sample binary image for ran-length coding.</i></center>
      <br>
      #The horizontal RLC Starts from the top-left pixel, scans the image from left to right, and generates the run-length vector. For the images in fig. the run-length vectors are as follows :-
      <br>
      <img src="../assets/images/image_processing/img_pro2.png" alt="" id="img1">
      <br>
      The maximum length here is five. It requires three bits in binary. The total number of vector is six. The maximum number of bits required is three. The number of bits per pixel, as the pixels od the image are either o or 1. Therefore, the total number of pixels is given by 6 X (3+1) = 24. The total number of bits of the original image is 5 x 5 = 25. Therefore, the compression ratio is 25/24, that is 1.042:1.
      <br>
      #The scan line can be changed. This change affects the compression ratio. Vertical line scanning of the same image yields. 
      <br>
      <img src="../assets/images/image_processing/img_pro3.png" alt="" id="img1">
      <br>
      Here the total number of vector = 10 <br>
      Maximum no. of bits = 3
      <br>
      Number of bits per pixel = 1
      <br>
      Therefore, 10 X (3+1) = 40
      <br>
      compression ratio = 25/24 = 0.625:1
      <br>
      It can be observed that this is signifivantly lesser than the previous schemes. <br>
      #The scan lines can be changed to a zig-zag line as shown in fig.

      <strong><u>Explain the need for Image compression in digital Image processing.</u></strong><br>
      With the advantaged development in internet, telecommunication, multimedia, and high-definition television technologies. The amount of information that is handled by computers has grown exporentially over the past decades. The amount of data transmitted through the internet doubles every year, and a large portion of that data comprises of image. Reducing the bandwidth needs of any given device will result in significant cost reductions and will make the use of the device more affordable. Image compression offers ways to represent an image in a more compact way, so that images can be stored in a compact manner and can be transmitted faster.
